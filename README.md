# Voltus twine jam

For hackweek! (and beyond?)

There is a basic premise to this Twine story (welcome to the Voltusverse). Besides that, no rules. The adventure could go anywhere. Add a new section, elaborate on something else someone added, the Voltusverse is your oyster.

## How it works

- Clone repo
- Use (Twinery UI)[https://twinery.org/2/#/] to upload (Library > Import)
- Make changes to game as you wish
- Download HTML file (Build > Publish to file)
- Rename to story.html
- Replace file in git repository
- Commit changes

## Rules

- Announce you are taking a turn in the voltus slack #hackweek-art-group channel
- Do NOT download and make changes if someone else is taking a turn (the html files are difficult to resolve conflicts)
- Once you declare a turn, try to complete your work as soon as possible
- Annouce you are done with your turn in voltus slack #hackweek-art-group channel once you commit
